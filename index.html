          <h2>Student at LeWagon</h2>
          <p>I'm an American expat who has been living in Asia since 2014. With experience in education, language acquisition, service, sales, technology, and social entrepreneurship, I've found my interests lie in supporting mission-driven projects that allow others to learn about themselves and the forces shaping our world.</p>

                  <p>Whoever hasn't seen the original Star Wars trilogy needs to stop whatever they are doing, right now, and go watch it. I mean, seriously. Have you lived under a rock for the last 40 years? Were you born after the year 2000? Do you think that the Star Wars prequels were the original movies? NO! The Empire Strikes Back is one of the most well balanced, well acted films in the Star Wars franchise. Go watch it. You won't be dissapointed.</p>

                  <h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
                  <p>Ya..ya..I know what you're thinking..."But Alex, this isn't a movie." You're right. It's not. But, it watches like a movie. Each episode of Game of Thrones is produced like it was a full blown motion picture. The action, the adventure. All well done. Two thumbs up.</p>

                  <p>Gandalf the white crests the ridge of the battfield as the sun rises behind him. The light blinds the Orakai warriors assaulting Helm's Deep. Next to Gandalf appears a Rohan soldier, then another, then an entire army of Rohan cavalry arrive as they charge down the hill at the awaiting Orkai. Damn... That's a good film.</p>
